This is a basic example of a sign-up form for a website. This project was created with: 
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS

The form asks a user for their full name, username, email address, home address, and phone number.

The website has basic functionality, so when the user puts in their information and submits the form, their information will only be displayed in the console.
